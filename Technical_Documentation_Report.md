# NYC Taxi Trip Data Explorer - Technical Documentation Report

## 1. Problem Framing and Dataset Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The New York City Taxi Trip dataset contains over 1.4 million trip records from taxi operations, representing a comprehensive view of urban mobility patterns within Manhattan and surrounding boroughs. Each record includes temporal, spatial, and operational metadata that provides insights into transportation behavior in one of the world's most dense urban environments.

### Dataset Structure and Context

The raw dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Temporal Data**: Pickup and dropoff timestamps with precision to seconds
- **Geospatial Data**: GPS coordinates for pickup and dropoff locations
- **Trip Metrics**: Trip duration, distance, and passenger count
- **Operational Data**: Vendor IDs, payment types, and fare information
- **System Flags**: Store-and-forward indicators and other metadata

### Data Challenges Identified

#### 1. Missing and Incomplete Records
During initial analysis, we discovered approximately 0.01% of records contained missing critical fields such as timestamps, coordinates, or trip duration. These records were excluded during the validation phase.

#### 2. Coordinate Anomalies
**Challenge**: Raw GPS coordinates contained obvious errors including:
- Zero coordinates (0.0, 0.0) indicating GPS failures
- Coordinates outside NYC metropolitan area (latitude/longitude beyond reasonable bounds)
- Coordinates in water bodies or impossible locations

**Solution**: Implemented boundary validation using NYC area constraints (40.0-41.0°N latitude, -75.0 to -73.0°W longitude) with additional validation for zero coordinates.

#### 3. Duration and Speed Outliers
**Challenge**: Trip durations ranged from impossible values (negative, zero, or extreme durations) to unrealistic speeds exceeding highway limits in urban areas.

**Solution**: Applied statistical outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
- Calculated Q1 and Q3 percentiles using custom quicksort algorithm
- Applied 1.5 × IQR rule for outlier boundaries
- Established reasonable bounds: 30 seconds minimum, 2 hours maximum duration
- Speed validation: Maximum 120 km/h to accommodate highway segments

#### 4. Temporal Inconsistencies
**Challenge**: Multiple datetime formats in the dataset and logical inconsistencies where dropoff time preceded pickup time.

**Solution**: Implemented robust datetime parsing with multiple format attempts and sequence validation.

### Data Processing Statistics

From the processed dataset (10,000 sample records):
- **Valid Records**: 9,404 (94.04%)
- **Excluded Records**: 596 (5.96%)
- **Primary Exclusion Reasons**:
  - Invalid duration (outside statistical bounds): 542 records
  - Trip too short (<100 meters, likely GPS errors): 54 records

### Unexpected Discovery

**Key Finding**: Speed analysis revealed that approximately 15% of taxi trips operate at speeds below 10 km/h, indicating significant congestion during peak hours. This finding influenced our decision to implement speed categorization as a derived feature and prompted the addition of speed-based insights in the dashboard.

**Impact on Design**: This observation led us to prioritize temporal analysis in our visualization strategy, creating time-of-day charts to correlate low-speed periods with rush hour patterns.

**Trade-offs**: 
- Chose Flask over Django for simplicity (no ORM overhead needed for this use case)
- SQLite vs PostgreSQL: Prioritized deployment simplicity over advanced query features

#### Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript + Chart.js
**Reasoning**:
- **No Framework Dependencies**: Reduces complexity and loading time
- **Chart.js**: Mature visualization library with responsive design and extensive chart types
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Direct DOM manipulation for optimal performance with data filtering

**Trade-offs**:
- Vanilla JS vs React/Vue: Prioritized simplicity and learning objectives over component reusability
- Chart.js vs D3.js: Chose Chart.js for ease of implementation over customization flexibility

### Database Schema Design

**Normalization Strategy**: Applied Third Normal Form (3NF) principles:

```sql
CREATE TABLE taxi_trips (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,      -- Synthetic key
    trip_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,              -- Business key
    vendor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,                -- Categorical data
    pickup_datetime TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Temporal index
    dropoff_datetime TEXT NOT NULL,
    passenger_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    pickup_longitude REAL NOT NULL,            -- Geospatial data
    pickup_latitude REAL NOT NULL,
    dropoff_longitude REAL NOT NULL,
    dropoff_latitude REAL NOT NULL,
    store_and_fwd_flag TEXT,
    trip_duration INTEGER NOT NULL,            -- Derived metrics
    distance_km REAL NOT NULL,
    speed_kmh REAL NOT NULL,
    time_of_day TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- Categorical derived
    trip_distance_category TEXT NOT NULL,
    hour INTEGER NOT NULL,                     -- Optimized queries
    day_of_week INTEGER NOT NULL,
    month INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**Indexing Strategy**: Created composite indexes on commonly filtered columns:
- `idx_pickup_datetime`: Temporal queries
- `idx_vendor_id`: Vendor filtering
- `idx_time_of_day`: Time period analysis
- `idx_distance_category`: Distance-based filtering

### Key Design Trade-offs

#### 1. Data Processing Volume
**Decision**: Limit initial processing to 10,000 records for demonstration
**Reasoning**: Balance between demonstration effectiveness and processing time
**Production Alternative**: Implement pagination and incremental loading

#### 2. Real-time vs Batch Processing
**Decision**: Batch processing with static dataset
**Reasoning**: Assignment focuses on analysis rather than streaming data
**Production Alternative**: Implement CDC (Change Data Capture) for real-time updates

#### 3. Client-side vs Server-side Aggregation
**Decision**: Hybrid approach - server aggregates chart data, client handles display logic
**Reasoning**: Optimizes bandwidth while maintaining responsive UI
**Trade-off**: Increased server processing vs network transfer costs

## 3. Algorithmic Logic and Data Structures

### Custom Quicksort Implementation

#### Purpose and Problem Addressed
The assignment required manual implementation of sorting algorithms without built-in libraries. Our quicksort implementation addresses outlier detection in duration analysis, enabling statistical boundary determination for data cleaning.

#### Implementation Details

```python
def quicksort_durations(arr, low, high):
    """
    Custom quicksort implementation for duration sorting
    
    Approach: Divide-and-conquer recursive sorting
    - Choose pivot element (rightmost)
    - Partition array around pivot
    - Recursively sort sub-arrays
    """
    if low < high:
        pi = partition_durations(arr, low, high)
        quicksort_durations(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quicksort_durations(arr, pi + 1, high)

def partition_durations(arr, low, high):
    """
    Partitioning logic for quicksort
    
    Logic:
    - Select rightmost element as pivot
    - Maintain index of smaller element
    - Swap elements to position smaller elements before pivot
    """
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1
    
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    
    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1
```

#### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**:
- **Best Case**: O(n log n) - When pivot consistently divides array in half
- **Average Case**: O(n log n) - Random pivot selection
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) - When pivot is always minimum or maximum element

**Space Complexity**:
- **O(log n)** - Recursive call stack depth in average case
- **O(n)** - Worst case recursive stack depth

#### Practical Application
The algorithm processes sampled duration values to determine statistical outliers:
1. Extract duration values from sample dataset (50,000 records)
2. Apply quicksort to achieve ordered sequence
3. Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
4. Determine outlier boundaries using IQR method: Q1 - 1.5×IQR and Q3 + 1.5×IQR

### Custom Haversine Distance Implementation

#### Purpose
Calculate great-circle distance between GPS coordinate pairs without using geospatial libraries.

```python
def haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    """
    Manual haversine formula implementation
    
    Mathematical approach:
    - Convert degrees to radians manually
    - Apply haversine formula for spherical geometry
    - Account for Earth's curvature in distance calculation
    """
    if not all([lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2]):
        return 0
    
    # Manual degree to radian conversion
    lat1_rad = lat1 * math.pi / 180
    lon1_rad = lon1 * math.pi / 180
    lat2_rad = lat2 * math.pi / 180
    lon2_rad = lon2 * math.pi / 180
    
    # Haversine formula
    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad
    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad
    
    a = (math.sin(dlat/2))**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * (math.sin(dlon/2))**2
    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))
    
    return 6371 * c  # Earth radius in kilometers
```

**Accuracy**: Provides accuracy within ±0.5% for distances under 1000km, suitable for urban taxi trip analysis.

## 4. Insights and Interpretation

### Insight 1: Peak Activity Analysis

**Derivation Method**: 
Aggregated trip counts by time-of-day categories through SQL GROUP BY operations:

```sql
SELECT time_of_day, COUNT(*) as count,
       AVG(trip_duration) as avg_duration
FROM taxi_trips 
GROUP BY time_of_day
```

**Finding**: Evening period (6PM-10PM) represents peak taxi activity with 35.2% of all trips, containing 3,312 trips from our 9,404-record dataset.

**Urban Mobility Interpretation**: 
This pattern aligns with commuter behavior in NYC, where residents rely on taxis during evening rush hour when public transit experiences maximum capacity constraints. The peak evening activity suggests taxi services serve as crucial "last-mile" transportation solutions during congested periods.

**Visualization**: Bar chart displaying trip distribution across morning, afternoon, evening, and night periods with color-coded time segments.

### Insight 2: Distance Distribution Patterns

**Derivation Method**:
Implemented custom distance categorization algorithm:
- Short: <2km (neighborhood travels)
- Medium: 2-10km (cross-borough travels)  
- Long: >10km (airport/suburban travels)

**Query Implementation**:
```sql
SELECT trip_distance_category, 
       COUNT(*) as count,
       (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM taxi_trips)) as percentage
FROM taxi_trips 
GROUP BY trip_distance_category
```

**Finding**: Short-distance trips (<2km) comprise 78.5% of all taxi journeys, totaling 7,382 trips in our dataset.

**Urban Mobility Interpretation**:
The predominance of short trips indicates taxis primarily serve intra-neighborhood mobility rather than long-distance transportation. This suggests NYC residents use taxis for:
- Last-mile connections from transit hubs
- Weather-dependent local transportation
- Accessibility needs within dense urban blocks
- Time-sensitive short-distance trips where walking would be impractical

**Visualization**: Doughnut chart showing proportional distribution with percentage labels and average speed overlay data.

### Insight 3: Traffic Speed Analysis

**Derivation Method**:
Cross-referenced speed calculations with distance categories and time periods:

```sql
SELECT trip_distance_category,
       AVG(speed_kmh) as avg_speed,
       MIN(speed_kmh) as min_speed,
       MAX(speed_kmh) as max_speed
FROM taxi_trips 
GROUP BY trip_distance_category
```

**Finding**: Average speed across all trip categories is 18.7 km/h, significantly below typical vehicle speeds, with short trips averaging 12.3 km/h.

**Urban Mobility Interpretation**:
The low average speeds reflect NYC's congested traffic conditions and frequent stop-and-go patterns characteristic of dense urban environments. Key implications:

1. **Traffic Congestion Impact**: Speeds well below free-flow conditions indicate systematic congestion affecting taxi efficiency
2. **Route Optimization Opportunity**: Low speeds suggest potential for traffic management improvements
3. **Modal Choice Implications**: Speed analysis helps explain when taxis are competitive vs. walking or cycling
4. **Environmental Considerations**: Low speeds correlate with higher fuel consumption and emissions per kilometer

**Visualization**: Tooltip integration in distance charts showing speed metrics, with color-coding indicating traffic efficiency levels.
