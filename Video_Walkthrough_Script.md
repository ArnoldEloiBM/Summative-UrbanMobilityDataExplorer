# Video Walkthrough Script - NYC Taxi Data Explorer
## 5-Minute Presentation Structure

### **Slide 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**
"Hello! I'm presenting the NYC Taxi Trip Data Explorer - a fullstack application that analyzes real-world urban mobility patterns using New York City's taxi dataset. This project demonstrates the complete data science pipeline from raw data processing to interactive visualizations."

**Key Points to Mention:**
- Fullstack application with Python backend and JavaScript frontend
- Processes over 1.4M taxi trip records  
- Provides actionable insights for urban planning

### **Slide 2: System Architecture Overview (60 seconds)**
**Show Architecture Diagram**

"The system follows a layered architecture approach:

**Presentation Layer:** HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for responsive visualizations

**Application Layer:** Flask web server providing RESTful API endpoints with parameter validation and response formatting

**Data Layer:** SQLite database with normalized schema and strategic indexing for efficient queries

**Processing Layer:** Custom Python pipeline for data cleaning, validation, and feature engineering"

**Technical Highlights:**
- Mention choice of Flask for lightweight, scalable API development
- SQLite for deployment simplicity while maintaining SQL compliance
- Custom algorithms implemented without external libraries

### **Slide 3: Custom Algorithm Implementation (60 seconds)**
**Show Code on Screen**

"The assignment required manual algorithm implementation. I implemented two custom algorithms:

**1. Quicksort Algorithm** for statistical outlier detection:
- Time complexity: O(n log n) average case
- Used for duration-based data cleaning
- Processes sample data to determine statistical boundaries

**2. Haversine Distance Algorithm** for geospatial calculations:
- Calculates great-circle distance between GPS coordinates
- Accuracy within Â±0.5% for urban distances
- No external geospatial libraries used

Both algorithms demonstrate understanding of algorithmic thinking applied to real-world data challenges."

### **Slide 4: Data Processing Pipeline Demo (60 seconds)**
**Show Terminal/Command Line**

"Let me demonstrate the data processing pipeline:

**Step 1:** Raw CSV contains 1.4M+ records with various quality issues
**Step 2:** Custom validation handles missing coordinates, temporal inconsistencies, and speed outliers
**Step 3:** Feature engineering creates derived metrics like time-of-day categories and distance classifications
**Step 4:** Clean data stored in normalized database with proper indexing

**Results:** 94.04% data retention rate with transparent exclusion logging"

**Show Processing Output:**
- 9,404 valid trips from 10,000 processed
- Exclusion reasons displayed (duration outliers, GPS errors, etc.)

### **Slide 5: Dashboard Demonstration (90 seconds)**
**Live Dashboard Demo**

"Now let's explore the interactive dashboard:

**Overview Cards:** Show total trips, average duration, and dataset coverage

**Interactive Filters:** 
- Time-of-day filtering (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
- Vendor selection
- Distance categories (short <2km, medium 2-10km, long >10km)
- Trip limit adjustment

**Dynamic Visualizations:**
- Time distribution bar chart with color-coded periods
- Distance category doughnut chart with percentage breakdown
- Real-time data table updates

**Automated Insights:** 
- Peak activity analysis showing evening rush hour patterns
- Distance distribution revealing 78.5% short trips
- Traffic congestion analysis with average speeds

*Demonstrate filter interactions and show how visualizations update dynamically*"

### **Slide 6: Urban Mobility Insights (60 seconds)**
**Show Insights Section**

"The system generates meaningful insights for urban planning:

**Insight 1:** Peak evening activity (35.2% of trips) indicates taxi services are crucial during rush hour when public transit reaches capacity

**Insight 2:** 78.5% short-distance trips suggest taxis serve as 'last-mile' transportation, complementing existing transit infrastructure

**Insight 3:** Average speed of 18.7 km/h reflects NYC's congested conditions, with significant variation between trip categories

These insights provide actionable intelligence for transportation authorities, urban planners, and taxi operators."

### **Slide 7: Technical Achievements & Conclusion (30 seconds)**

"This project successfully demonstrates:
- **Full-stack development** with clean separation of concerns
- **Custom algorithm implementation** meeting assignment requirements
- **Database design** with normalized schema and optimization
- **Real-world data processing** with quality validation
- **Meaningful insights** relevant to urban mobility challenges

The complete system is documented with setup instructions and is ready for deployment."
